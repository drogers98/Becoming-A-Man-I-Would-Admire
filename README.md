A Journey To Becoming A Man That I Admire
=========================

Thoughts, and reflection on life, as provided by a recent short chapter, and what I can still learn, and provide by living fully.

Things happen for a reason. Part of opening up yourself for the opportunity for true happiness, is accepting that you will undoubdetly also experience bouts of pain along the journey. I know that now.

I suppose that I have always guarded my emotions too strongly in the past. A suit of armor, not to be penetrated by lifes slings and arrows. A way to stand and fight. As a young man, as a warrior, this made sense. I watched over and over what happened to men who wore their armor too lightly. Broken phonebooths in Korea, sleepless nights in Iraq, reckless behavior, loss of focus, loss of control. The cost of letting your guard down surrounded me constantly. I couldnt afford it. Strong men brought to their knees. This was my primer into the world of mastering, and masking emotion. It turned out to be a poor one. The Infantry is many things, but a catalyst of mastering a positive philosophy on life, and love, surely it is not.

At the time, I thought these men I observed to be fools, I thought them weak. I know better now. I went through my life with a knife, ruthlessly cutting women away, less my armor be peirced. Less I lose focus. Less I be weakened. Whether conciously or not, I approached relationships as a battleground. Kill or be killed. Better to coterize the wound, less it become infected. Cut and run. A tactical retreat. I understand now, fully, that the knife was the very thing that made me weak. Strong men do not need it, do not want it.

My time for fighting now is through. I tire of it. Best left for younger men, for better men. For stronger men. I told myself when I left the war, that I would strive to be a more positive force in the world, a better man than I was yesterday. I dont think I fully realized what that meant untill somewhat recently. I know now that it takes more than lip service. I know it takes strength and courage. The strength to endure, the courage to accept. Letting go of the knife has proven harder than I imagined though. Old habits are hard to break, as they say.

I think now about the men I truly admire. Great men. Men who have shaped my existance, in a large or small way. Far stronger men than I feel I could ever be, though I know now that their strength lies in the struggle. The commonality of their strength, as I understand it, is that of truth, love, forgiveness, courage, and the idea of selfless action. The knife has no place in this mix. Some of these men were also warriors once, and some are still, so I feel there is hope for me yet.
