A Journey To Becoming A Man That I Admire
=========================

Thoughts on life, letting your guard down, and embracing the ideal.
-------------------------

Things happen for a reason. Part of opening up yourself for the opportunity for true happiness, is accepting that you will undoubdetly also experience small bouts of pain along the journey. I know that now. It's part of the balance. Part of the game. Part of fully living in the moment.

I suppose that I have always guarded my emotions too strongly in the past. A suit of armor, not to be penetrated by lifes slings and arrows. A way to stand and fight. As a young man, as a warrior, this made sense. I watched over and over what happened to men who wore their armor too lightly. Broken phonebooths in Korea, sleepless nights in Iraq, reckless behavior, loss of focus, loss of control. The cost of letting your guard down surrounded me constantly. Broken men. I couldnt afford it. Strong men brought to their knees. At the time, I thought these men I observed to be foolish, I thought them weak. I know better now. I went through my life with a knife, ruthlessly cutting relationships away, less my armor be peirced. Less I lose focus. Less I be weakened. Whether conciously or not, I approached relationships as a battleground. Kill or be killed. Better to coterize the wound, less it become infected. Cut and run. A tactical retreat. 

This was my primer into understanding the world of the emotions and actions of men. Show no weakness, let no one in who may injure, keep your guard up, be ruthless. It turned out to be a poor, and misguided one. I know that now. The US Army Infantry is many things, but a catalyst of mastering a positive personal philosophy on life, relationships, and love, surely it is not. I can now see that clearly now. We need to do better. It's easy to train a boy to violence of action, but that does not make him a man. Mercy, forgiveness, and empathy always. Overwhelming violence only when you must, and even then, norrowly focused. This is where true power lies. As a society & culture, we need to create more complete men. Stronger men. We need to create the warrior poets of old.

My time for fighting now is through. I tire of it. Best left for younger men, for better men. For stronger men. I understand now, fully, that the knife was the very thing that made me weak. Truly strong men do not need it, do not want it. I told myself when I left the war, that I would strive to be a more positive force in the world, a better man than I was yesterday. I dont think I fully realized what that meant until somewhat recently. I know now that it takes more than lip service. I know it takes strength and courage. The strength to endure, the courage to accept. It takes truth. Letting go of the knife has proven harder than I imagined though. Old habits are hard to break, as they say. I feel defenseless without it, but now realize that this feeling is exactly what is needed. Too strong of a sheild repels the positives, along with the negatives. It is a barrier to living a full life. A blockade to a whole and complete human experience. It weighs you down. A barrier to living in the moment. I need to be faster, lighter, more agile.

I think now about the men I truly admire. Great men. Men who have shaped my existance, in some large or small portion. My father, my family, and men that I know know were my mentors in life, whether they know it or not. These men are far stronger than I feel I could ever be, though I know now that their strength lies in the struggle. Forces of positivity and light in a society all together covered by a vague darkness. The commonality of their strength, as I understand it, is that of charachter, truth, wisdom, love, forgiveness, courage, and the idea of selfless action. The knife has no place in this mix. Most of these men were also warriors once, and some are still, so I feel there is hope for me yet. I strive for this. I strive for the strength to be positive in the face of adversity.

I choose now fully to drop the knife, and lower the sheild. With that comes the occasional injury, perhaps, but also a lightness of being, that can only come from going un-armored, and un-burdened through life. I understand that now. I will replace the shield with acceptance. I will replace the knife with compassion. I will replace the constant thought of self defense with the knowledge that I am strong enough to take a blow, should it come. By experiencing the true nature and power of relationships. The good, the bad, and the ugly. The type of man I strive to be Understands that. So I must as well.
